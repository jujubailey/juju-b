Tomorrow I will finish the last day of my first week at the Boulder Media House. I'll finalize edits on a wedding video, specifically color edits. The BMH CEO and the previous intern in my position shot the wedding last weekend and collected nearly 6 hours of footage. The better part of my first day was spent orienting myself with the company's procedure and the organization throughout the Premiere file. The rest have been dedicated to finishing the assignment: a practice video. 

The company is an eclectic of media designers who collaborate on work as it is contracted to one of three departments. I work specifically for the Buffalo Film Company; which is hired to develop wedding videos. I aspire to develop a working relationship with BMH going forward, sections that demand intensive editing in After Effects, Davinci, Cinema 4D, etc..

The video I am currently working on is taking a lot of time and effort. I have never worked with a project with so much footage before. Maintaining organization within the project file has been difficult. Emma, my direct advisor within BFC, showed me how to set up the file with sequences for the Ceremony, Rehearsal and Toasts. Sorting through the footage is difficult, especially because many of the best moments were filmed from multiple angles, so avoiding repeats is a struggle. The draft of the project I finished this week was nearly 10 minutes long. I need to color edit and clean audio.

I am enjoying my work so far but I am looking to move into a different part of the company as soon as possible. I have spent my time so far taking footage of weddings and creating 7-10 minute cuts to deliver to clients. I also spent the better part of the last week developing 1 minute cuts of their previous wedding videos to add to the BFC Instagram page. While I am learning a lot in terms of editing within Premiere Pro I am looking to develop more skills in After Effects.

The videos I'm working on are starting to look better and I'm eager to close out my first projects in the next week. I've worked on two wedding videos for a couple weeks now, the company expects three week turn-arounds but I'm hoping to start finishing videos much sooner than that as I learn the process. My biggest challenges have been cleaning audio, color grading, and stabilization. I hope in the growth process I'll be able to create more creative transitions and effects.

Everything is going well at the studio. I've been working on setting up their new Instagram page; finding old photos, piecing together 1 minute cuts and setting everything up on a planner app. It's not the most challenging but it keeps me busy. I'm coming up on my first deadline, the middle of this week my first video should be sent to the client. The CEO sat down with me last week to give feedback on the video, he said it needed work on smoothing the audio. Hopefully I was able to correct that in this draft, but I'm still waiting on feedback.

Things are going well with the internship, the last time we spoke I was preparing to send my first completed wedding to the client. It is my understanding that it has been sent and I'm just waiting to see it pop up on vimeo. i'll send over a link asap. 

this week I am scheduled to finish the next video. i'm in my 14th draft of the wedding but it's starting to look promising. I struggled on this one more than the first because the audio was poor and shots were shaky. 

the company is producing incredible projects i'm hoping in a couple weeks i'll be considered for a bigger role.

All is going well at the internship. I submitted the next wedding, I haven't heard back about whether we are sending it out as is or if it needs more work. However, I have started on a new wedding, i'm hoping to have the first cut done by the end of the week. I'm enjoying the work here and I hope they will ask me to continue working for them when I return to school. Luckily a lot of the work I do can be done remotely. In fact I work off of my own laptop everyday now (the work computer moves too slowly). I've been really stressed trying to get everything in for my capstone project but once that is over on Friday I will put the website up. I hope you can forgive my delay, I plan to have an update posted for each week that's past.

 I worked as an PA on my first shoot yesterday. It was just me aside from the head photographer, videographer and producer. We shot for a van company called Titan located in Boulder. It was an 18 hour day but I had a great time and learned a lot. I'm starting to get offers from BMH to work paid shoots and I'm hoping they'll keep me on as an editor during the year.

In my final week I was assigned to another wedding to work on from home. During the week I created a reel for the BFC Instagram page that got over 18k views. In a disucssion with one of the BFC team leads, she suggested that I take a paid position to operate their page during the school year. I was also invited to work my first paid wedding with plan for more going forward. I have learned so much and truly enjoyed my time at BMH and am eager too see what will come next.
